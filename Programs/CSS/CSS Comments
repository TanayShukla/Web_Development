### CSS Comments
CSS comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your source code.

### CSS Comments
Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.

Comments are ignored by browsers.

A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with */:

Example
/* This is a single-line comment */
p {
  color: red;
}
### You can add comments wherever you want in the code:

Example
p {
  color: red;  /* Set text color to red */
}
### Comments can also span multiple lines: 

Example
/* This is
a multi-line
comment */

p {
  color: red;
}
