HTML Background Images
A background image can be specified for almost any HTML element.

Background Image on a HTML element
To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property:

Example
Add a background image on a HTML element:

<div style="background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');">
You can also specify the background image in the <style> element, in the <head> section:

Example
Specify the background image in the <style> element:

<style>
div {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
}
</style>
Background Image on a Page
If you want the entire page to have a background image, you must specify the background image on the <body> element:

Example
Add a background image for the entire page:

<style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
}
</style>
Background Repeat
If the background image is smaller than the element, the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically, until it reaches the end of the element:

Example
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('example_img_girl.jpg');
}
</style>
To avoid the background image from repeating itself, set the background-repeat property to no-repeat.

Example
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('example_img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
</style>
Background Cover
If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover.

Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed:

This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions):

Example
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-size: cover;
}
</style>
Background Stretch
If you want the background image to stretch to fit the entire element, you can set the background-size property to 100% 100%:

Try resizing the browser window, and you will see that the image will stretch, but always cover the entire element.

Example
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-size: 100% 100%;
}
</style>
