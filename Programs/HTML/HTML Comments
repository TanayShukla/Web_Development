### HTML Comments
HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

### HTML Comment Tags
You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:

<!-- Write your comments here -->
Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.

Note: Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code:

Example
<!-- This is a comment -->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- Remember to add more information here -->
Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors:

Example
<!-- Do not display this image at the moment
<img border="0" src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
-->
